Three different resampling algorithms
I. rejection sampling
II. likelihood weighted sampling
III. Gibbs sampling

Apply each of the three algorithms to the following tasks.

1. Compute the following probabilities, directly, without sampling. Then employ each of the three sampling algorithms to approximate the probabilities. Use 1000 samples for each method and document your results. How do the approximations compare to the true values?
