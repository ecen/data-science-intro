# ### 1) The branching factor d of a directed graph is the maximum number of children (outer degree) of a node in the graph. Suppose that the shortest path between the initial state and a goal is of length r.
# ### a) What is the maximum number of BFS iterations required to reach the solution in terms of d and r?
__Answer:__


# ### b) Suppose that storing each node requires one unit of memory. Hence, storing a path with k nodes requires k units of memory. What is the maximum amount of memory required for BFS in terms of d and r?
